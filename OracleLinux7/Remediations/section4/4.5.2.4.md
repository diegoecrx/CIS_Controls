# 4.5.2.4 Ensure root password is set

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash
/bin/grep -Eq '^root:\$(y|[0-9]|g)' /etc/shadow && echo 'root password is set' || echo 'root password is not set'
```

**Expected Output:**
```
^root password is set$
```

## Solution

Set the root password with:

# passwd root

Impact:

If there are any automated processes that relies on access to the root account without authentication, they will fail after remediation.
