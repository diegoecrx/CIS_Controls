# 4.5.1.1 Ensure strong password hashing algorithm is configured

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Note: If yescrypt becomes available in a future release, this would also be acceptable. It is highly recommended that the chosen hashing algorithm is consistent across /etc/libuser.conf /etc/login.defs /etc/pam.d/password-auth and /etc/pam.d/system-auth

Set password hashing algorithm to sha512.

Edit /etc/libuser.conf and edit or add the following line:

crypt_style = sha512

Edit /etc/login.defs and edit or add the following line:

ENCRYPT_METHOD SHA512

Note: This only effects local users and passwords created after updating the files to use sha512 or yescrypt If it is determined that the password algorithm being used is not sha512 or yescrypt once it is changed, it is recommended that all group passwords be updated to use the stronger hashing algorithm.
