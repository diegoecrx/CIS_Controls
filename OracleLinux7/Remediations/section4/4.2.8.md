# 4.2.8 Ensure sshd DisableForwarding is enabled

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash
multiple line script
```

**Expected Output:**
```
(?i)^[\s]*\**[\s]*pass:?[\s]*\**$
```

## Solution

Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the DisableForwarding parameter to yes :

DisableForwarding yes

Note: First occurrence of a option takes precedence.

Impact:

SSH tunnels are widely used in many corporate environments. In some environments the applications themselves may have very limited native support for security. By utilizing tunneling, compliance with SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and other standards can be achieved without having to modify the applications.
