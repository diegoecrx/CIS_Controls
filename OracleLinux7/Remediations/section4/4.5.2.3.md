# 4.5.2.3 Ensure system accounts are secured

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

System accounts

Set the shell for any accounts returned by the audit to nologin :

# usermod -s $(command -v nologin) 

Disabled accounts

Lock any non root accounts returned by the audit:

# usermod -L 

Large scale changes

The following command will set all system accounts to nologin :

# awk -F: '($1!~/^(root|halt|sync|shutdown|nfsnobody)$/ && ($3/dev/null; done

The following command will automatically lock all accounts that have their shell set to nologin :

# awk -F: '/nologin/ {print $1}' /etc/passwd | while read user; do usermod -L $user; done
