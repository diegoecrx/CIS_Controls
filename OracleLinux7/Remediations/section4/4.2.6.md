## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash
multiple line script
```

**Expected Output:**
```
^Pass$
```

## Solution

Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and add or modify the Ciphers line to contain a comma separated list of the site approved (Strong) Ciphers:

Example:

Ciphers chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr

Note: First occurrence of an option takes precedence.
