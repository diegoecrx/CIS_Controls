# 4.3.6 Ensure sudo authentication timeout is configured correctly

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

If the currently configured timeout is larger than 15 minutes, edit the file listed in the audit section with visudo -f  and modify the entry timestamp_timeout= to 15 minutes or less as per your site policy. The value is in minutes. This particular entry may appear on its own, or on the same line as env_reset See the following two examples:

Defaults env_reset, timestamp_timeout=15 Defaults timestamp_timeout=15
Defaults env_reset
