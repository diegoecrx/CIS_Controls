# 4.4.2.2.6 Ensure password maximum sequential characters is configured

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Edit /etc/security/pwquality.conf and add or modify the following line to set maxsequence to 3 or less and not 0 Ensure setting conforms to local site policy:

maxsequence = 3

Run the following script to remove setting maxsequence on the pam_pwquality.so module in the PAM files:

#!/usr/bin/env bash

{
   for l_pam_file in system-auth password-auth; do
     sed -ri 's/(^s*passwords+(requisite|required|sufficient)s+pam_pwquality.so.*)(s+maxsequences*=s*S+)(.*$)/14/' /etc/pam.d/"$l_pam_file"
   done
}
