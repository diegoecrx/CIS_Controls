# 2.2.9 Ensure network file system services are not in use

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Run the following command to stop nfs-server.service and remove nfs-utils package:

# systemctl stop nfs-server.service
# yum remove nfs-utils

-OR-

-IF- the nfs-utils package is required as a dependency:

Run the following commands to stop and mask the nfs-server.service :

# systemctl stop nfs-server.service
# systemctl mask nfs-server.service

Impact:

Many of the libvirt packages used by Enterprise Linux virtualization are dependent on the nfs-utils package. If the nfs-utils package is removed, these dependent packages will be removed as well. Before removing the nfs-utils package, review any dependent packages to determine if they are required on the system.

-IF- a dependent package is required: stop and mask the nfs-server.service leaving the nfs-utils package installed.
