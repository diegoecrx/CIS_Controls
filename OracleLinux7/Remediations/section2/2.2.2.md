# 2.2.2 Ensure avahi daemon services are not in use

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Run the following commands to stop avahi-daemon.socket and avahi-daemon.service and remove the avahi package:

# systemctl stop avahi-daemon.socket avahi-daemon.service
# yum remove avahi

-OR-

-IF- the avahi package is required as a dependency:

Run the following commands to stop and mask the avahi-daemon.socket and avahi-daemon.service :

# systemctl stop avahi-daemon.socket avahi-daemon.service
# systemctl mask avahi-daemon.socket avahi-daemon.service

Impact:

There may be packages that are dependent on the avahi package. If the avahi package is removed, these dependent packages will be removed as well. Before removing the avahi package, review any dependent packages to determine if they are required on the system.

-IF- a dependent package is required: stop and mask the avahi-daemon.socket and avahi-daemon.service leaving the avahi package installed.
