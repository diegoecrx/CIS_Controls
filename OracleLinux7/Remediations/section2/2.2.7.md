# 2.2.7 Ensure ftp server services are not in use

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Run the following commands to stop vsftpd.service and remove vsftpd package:

# systemctl stop vsftpd.service
# yum remove vsftpd

-OR-

-IF- the vsftpd package is required as a dependency:

Run the following commands to stop and mask the vsftpd.service :

# systemctl stop vsftpd.service
# systemctl mask vsftpd.service

Note: Other ftp server packages may exist. If not required and authorized by local site policy, they should also be removed. If the package is required for a dependency, the service should be stopped and masked.

Impact:

There may be packages that are dependent on the vsftpd package. If the vsftpd package is removed, these dependent packages will be removed as well. Before removing the vsftpd package, review any dependent packages to determine if they are required on the system.

-IF- a dependent package is required: stop and mask the vsftpd.service leaving the vsftpd package installed.
