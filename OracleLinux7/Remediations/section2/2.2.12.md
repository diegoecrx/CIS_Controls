# 2.2.12 Ensure rpcbind services are not in use

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Run the following commands to stop rpcbind.socket and rpcbind.service and remove the rpcbind package:

# systemctl stop rpcbind.socket rpcbind.service
# yum remove rpcbind

-OR-

-IF- the rpcbind package is required as a dependency:

Run the following commands to stop and mask the rpcbind.socket and rpcbind.service :

# systemctl stop rpcbind.socket rpcbind.service
# systemctl mask rpcbind.socket rpcbind.service

Impact:

Many of the libvirt packages used by Enterprise Linux virtualization, and the nfs-utils package used for The Network File System (NFS), are dependent on the rpcbind package. If the rpcbind package is removed, these dependent packages will be removed as well. Before removing the rpcbind package, review any dependent packages to determine if they are required on the system.

-IF- a dependent package is required: stop and mask the rpcbind.socket and rpcbind.service leaving the rpcbind package installed.
