# 2.2.21 Ensure mail transfer agents are configured for local-only mode (Automated)

## Remediation

Edit /etc/postfix/main.cf and add the following line to the RECEIVING MAIL section.
If the line already exists, change it to look like the line below:
inet_interfaces = loopback-only
Run the following command to restart postfix:
# systemctl restart postfix




Note:
•
This remediation is designed around the postfix mail server.
•
Depending on your environment you may have an alternative MTA installed such
as sendmail. If this is the case consult the documentation for your installed MTA
to configure the recommended state.
