# 2.2.3 Ensure dhcp server services are not in use

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Run the following commands to stop dhcpd.service and dhcpd6.service and remove dhcp package:

# systemctl stop dhcpd.service dhcpd6.service
# yum remove dhcp

-OR-

-IF- the dhcp package is required as a dependency:

Run the following commands to stop and mask dhcpd.service and dhcpd6.service :

# systemctl stop dhcpd.service dhcpd6.service
# systemctl mask dhcpd.service dhcpd6.service

Impact:

There may be packages that are dependent on the dhcp-server package. If the dhcp-server package is removed, these dependent packages will be removed as well. Before removing the dhcp-server package, review any dependent packages to determine if they are required on the system.

-IF- a dependent package is required: stop and mask the dhcpd.service and dhcpd6.service leaving the dhcp-server package installed.
