# 2.2.11 Ensure print server services are not in use

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Run the following commands to stop cups.socket and cups.service and remove the cups package:

# systemctl stop cups.socket cups.service
# yum remove cups

-OR-

-IF- the cups package is required as a dependency:

Run the following commands to stop and mask the cups.socket and cups.service :

# systemctl stop cups.socket cups.service
# systemctl mask cups.socket cups.service

Impact:

Removing the cups package, or disabling cups.socket and/or cups.service will prevent printing from the system, a common task for workstation systems.

There may be packages that are dependent on the cups package. If the cups package is removed, these dependent packages will be removed as well. Before removing the cups package, review any dependent packages to determine if they are required on the system.

-IF- a dependent package is required: stop and mask cups.socket and cups.service leaving the cups package installed.
