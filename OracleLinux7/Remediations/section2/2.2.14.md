# 2.2.14 Ensure snmp services are not in use

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Run the following commands to stop snmpd.service and remove net-snmp package:

# systemctl stop snmpd.service
# yum remove net-snmp

-OR- If the package is required for dependencies:

Run the following commands to stop and mask the snmpd.service :

# systemctl stop snmpd.service
# systemctl mask snmpd.service

Impact:

There may be packages that are dependent on the net-snmp package. If the net-snmp package is removed, these packages will be removed as well.

Before removing the net-snmp package, review any dependent packages to determine if they are required on the system. If a dependent package is required, stop and mask the snmpd.service leaving the net-snmp package installed.
