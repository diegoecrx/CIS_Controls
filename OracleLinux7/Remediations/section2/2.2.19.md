```

## Solution

Run the following commands to stop xinetd.service and remove the xinetd package:

# systemctl stop xinetd.service
# yum remove xinetd

-OR-

-IF- the xinetd package is required as a dependency:

Run the following commands to stop and mask the xinetd.service :

# systemctl stop xinetd.service
# systemctl mask xinetd.service

Impact:

There may be packages that are dependent on the xinetd package. If the xinetd package is removed, these dependent packages will be removed as well. Before removing the xinetd package, review any dependent packages to determine if they are required on the system.

-IF- a dependent package is required: stop and mask the avahi-daemon.socket and avahi-daemon.service leaving the avahi package installed.
