```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Run the following commands to stop autofs.service and remove autofs package:

# systemctl stop autofs.service
# yum remove autofs

-OR-

-IF- the autofs package is required as a dependency:

Run the following commands to stop and mask autofs.service :

# systemctl stop autofs.service
# systemctl mask autofs.service

Impact:

The use of portable hard drives is very common for workstation users. If your organization allows the use of portable storage or media on workstations and physical access controls to workstations is considered adequate there is little value add in turning off automounting.

There may be packages that are dependent on the autofs package. If the autofs package is removed, these dependent packages will be removed as well. Before removing the autofs package, review any dependent packages to determine if they are required on the system.

-IF- a dependent package is required: stop and mask the autofs.service leaving the autofs package installed.
