# 2.2.18 Ensure web server services are not in use

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Run the following commands to stop httpd.socket httpd.service and nginx.service and remove httpd and nginx packages:

# systemctl stop httpd.socket httpd.service nginx.service
# yum remove httpd nginx

-OR-

-IF- a package is installed and is required for dependencies:

Run the following commands to stop and mask httpd.socket httpd.service and nginx.service :

# systemctl stop httpd.socket httpd.service nginx.service
# systemctl mask httpd.socket httpd.service nginx.service

Note: Other web server packages may exist. If not required and authorized by local site policy, they should also be removed. If the package is required for a dependency, the service and socket should be stopped and masked.

Impact:

Removal of web server packages will remove that ability for the server to host web services.

-IF- the web server package is required for a dependency, any related service or socket should be stopped and masked.

Note: If the remediation steps to mask a service are followed and that package is not installed on the system, the service and/or socket will still be masked. If the package is installed due to an approved requirement to host a web server, the associated service and/or socket would need to be unmasked before it could be enabled and/or started.
