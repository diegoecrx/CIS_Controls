# 2.2.18 Ensure web server services are not in use (Automated)

## Remediation

Run the following commands to stop httpd.socket, httpd.service, and nginx.service,
and remove httpd and nginx packages:
# systemctl stop httpd.socket httpd.service nginx.service
# yum remove httpd nginx
-OR-
-IF- a package is installed and is required for dependencies:
Run the following commands to stop and mask httpd.socket, httpd.service, and
nginx.service:
# systemctl stop httpd.socket httpd.service nginx.service
# systemctl mask httpd.socket httpd.service nginx.service
Note: Other web server packages may exist. If not required and authorized by local site
policy, they should also be removed. If the package is required for a dependency, the
service and socket should be stopped and masked.
