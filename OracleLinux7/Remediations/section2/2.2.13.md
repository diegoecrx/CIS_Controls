# 2.2.13 Ensure rsync services are not in use

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Run the following commands to stop rsyncd.socket and rsyncd.service and remove the rsync package:

# systemctl stop rsyncd.socket rsyncd.service
# yum remove rsync

-OR-

-IF- the rsync package is required as a dependency:

Run the following commands to stop and mask the rsyncd.socket and rsyncd.service :

# systemctl stop rsyncd.socket rsyncd.service
# systemctl mask rsyncd.socket rsyncd.service

Impact:

There may be packages that are dependent on the rsync package. If the rsync package is removed, these dependent packages will be removed as well. Before removing the rsync package, review any dependent packages to determine if they are required on the system.

-IF- a dependent package is required: stop and mask the rsyncd.socket and rsyncd.service leaving the rsync package installed.
