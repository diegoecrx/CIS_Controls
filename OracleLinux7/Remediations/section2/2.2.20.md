# 2.2.20 Ensure X window server services are not in use

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

-IF- a Graphical Desktop Manager or X-Windows server is not required and approved by local site policy:

Run the following command to remove the X Windows Server packages:

# yum remove xorg-x11-server-common

Impact:

If a Graphical Desktop Manager (GDM) is in use on the system, there may be a dependency on the xorg-x11-server-common package. If the GDM is required and approved by local site policy, the package should not be removed.

Many Linux systems run applications which require a Java runtime. Some Linux Java packages have a dependency on specific X Windows xorg-x11-fonts. One workaround to avoid this dependency is to use the "headless" Java packages for your specific Java runtime.
