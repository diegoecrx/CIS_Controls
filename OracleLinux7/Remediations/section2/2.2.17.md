## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Run the following commands to stop squid.service and remove the squid package:

# systemctl stop squid.service
# yum remove squid

-OR- If the squid package is required as a dependency:

Run the following commands to stop and mask the squid.service :

# systemctl stop squid.service
# systemctl mask squid.service

Impact:

There may be packages that are dependent on the squid package. If the squid package is removed, these dependent packages will be removed as well. Before removing the squid package, review any dependent packages to determine if they are required on the system.

-IF- a dependent package is required: stop and mask the squid.service leaving the squid package installed.
