# 2.2.22 Ensure only approved services are listening on a network interface

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash
/sbin/ss -plntu
```

**Expected Output:**
```
^Manual Review Required$
```

## Solution

Run the following commands to stop the service and remove the package containing the service:

# systemctl stop .socket .service
# yum remove 

-OR- If required packages have a dependency:

Run the following commands to stop and mask the service and socket:

# systemctl stop .socket .service
# systemctl mask .socket .service

Note: replace  with the appropriate service name.

Impact:

There may be packages that are dependent on the service's package. If the service's package is removed, these dependent packages will be removed as well. Before removing the service's package, review any dependent packages to determine if they are required on the system.

-IF- a dependent package is required: stop and mask the .socket and .service leaving the service's package installed.
