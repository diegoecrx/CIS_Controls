```

## Solution

Run the following commands to stop telnet.socket and remove the telnet-server package:

# systemctl stop telnet.socket
# yum remove telnet-server

-OR-

-IF- a package is installed and is required for dependencies:

Run the following commands to stop and mask telnet.socket :

# systemctl stop telnet.socket
# systemctl mask telnet.socket

Impact:

There may be packages that are dependent on the telnet-server package. If the telnet-server package is removed, these dependent packages will be removed as well. Before removing the telnet-server package, review any dependent packages to determine if they are required on the system.

-IF- a dependent package is required: stop and mask the telnet.socket leaving the telnet-server package installed.
