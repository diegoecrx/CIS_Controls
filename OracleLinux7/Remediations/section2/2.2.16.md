# 2.2.16 Ensure tftp server services are not in use

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Run the following commands to stop tftp.socket and tftp.service and remove the tftp-server package:

# systemctl stop tftp.socket tftp.service
# yum remove tftp-server

-OR-

-IF- the tftp-server package is required as a dependency:

Run the following commands to stop and mask tftp.socket and tftp.service :

# systemctl stop tftp.socket tftp.service
# systemctl mask tftp.socket tftp.service

Impact:

TFTP is often used to provide files for network booting such as for PXE based installation of servers.

There may be packages that are dependent on the tftp-server package. If the tftp-server package is removed, these dependent packages will be removed as well. Before removing the tftp-server package, review any dependent packages to determine if they are required on the system.

-IF- a dependent package is required: stop and mask the tftp.socket and tftp.service leaving the tftp-server package installed.
