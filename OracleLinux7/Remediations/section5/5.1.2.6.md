# 5.1.2.6 Ensure journald log rotation is configured per site policy (Manual)

## Remediation

Review /etc/systemd/journald.conf and verify logs are rotated according to site
policy. The settings should be carefully understood as there are specific edge cases
and prioritization of parameters.
The specific parameters for log rotation are:
SystemMaxUse=
SystemKeepFree=
RuntimeMaxUse=
RuntimeKeepFree=
MaxFileSec=
Additional Information:
See man 5 journald.conf for detailed information regarding the parameters in use.
