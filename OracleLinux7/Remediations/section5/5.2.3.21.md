# 5.2.3.21 Ensure the running and on disk configuration is the same

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash
/sbin/augenrules --check
```

**Expected Output:**
```
^[\s]*/sbin/augenrules:[\s]*No change[\s]*$
```

## Solution

If the rules are not aligned across all three () areas, run the following command to merge and load all rules:

# augenrules --load

Check if reboot is required.

if [[ $(auditctl -s | grep "enabled") =~ "2" ]]; then echo "Reboot required to load rules"; fi
