# 5.2.3.21 Ensure the running and on disk configuration is the same (Manual)

## Remediation

If the rules are not aligned across all three () areas, run the following command to
merge and load all rules:
# augenrules --load
Check if reboot is required.
if [[ $(auditctl -s | grep "enabled") =~ "2" ]]; then echo "Reboot required
to load rules"; fi




Additional Information:
Potential reboot required
If the auditing configuration is locked (-e 2), then augenrules will not warn in any way
that rules could not be loaded into the running configuration. A system reboot will be
required to load the rules into the running configuration.
