## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Edit the /etc/rsyslog.conf and /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf files and add the following line (where loghost.example.com is the name of your central log host). The target directive may either be a fully qualified domain name or an IP address.

*.* action(type="omfwd" target="192.168.2.100" port="514" protocol="tcp"
           action.resumeRetryCount="100"
           queue.type="LinkedList" queue.size="1000")

Run the following command to reload the rsyslogd configuration:

# systemctl restart rsyslog
