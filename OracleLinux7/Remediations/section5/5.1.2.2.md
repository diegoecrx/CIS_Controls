# 5.1.2.2 Ensure journald service is enabled (Automated)

## Remediation

By default the systemd-journald service does not have an [Install] section and thus
cannot be enabled / disabled. It is meant to be referenced as Requires or Wants by other
unit files. As such, if the status of systemd-journald is not static, investigate why.
