# 5.1.2.2 Ensure journald service is enabled

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

By default the systemd-journald service does not have an [Install] section and thus cannot be enabled / disabled. It is meant to be referenced as Requires or Wants by other unit files. As such, if the status of systemd-journald is not static investigate why.
