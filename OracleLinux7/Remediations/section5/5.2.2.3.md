# 5.2.2.3 Ensure system is disabled when audit logs are full

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Set one of the following parameters in /etc/audit/auditd.conf depending on your local security policies.

disk_full_action = 
disk_error_action = 

Example:

disk_full_action = halt
disk_error_action = halt

Impact:

-IF-

 - The disk_full_action parameter is set to halt the auditd daemon will shutdown the system when the disk partition containing the audit logs becomes full.
 - The disk_full_action parameter is set to single the auditd daemon will put the computer system in single user mode when the disk partition containing the audit logs becomes full.

-IF-

 - The disk_error_action parameter is set to halt the auditd daemon will shutdown the system when an error is detected on the partition that holds the audit log files.
 - The disk_error_action parameter is set to single the auditd daemon will put the computer system in single user mode when an error is detected on the partition that holds the audit log files.
 - The disk_error_action parameter is set to syslog the auditd daemon will issue no more than 5 consecutive warnings to syslog when an error is detected on the partition that holds the audit log files.
