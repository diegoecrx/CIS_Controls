# 5.2.3.12 Ensure login and logout events are collected

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Edit or create a file in the /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory, ending inrules extension, with the relevant rules to monitor login and logout events.

Example:

# printf "
-w /var/log/lastlog -p wa -k logins
-w /var/run/faillock -p wa -k logins
" >> /etc/audit/rules.d/50-login.rules

Merge and load the rules into active configuration:

# augenrules --load

Check if reboot is required.

# if [[ $(auditctl -s | grep "enabled") =~ "2" ]]; then printf "Reboot required to load rules
"; fi
