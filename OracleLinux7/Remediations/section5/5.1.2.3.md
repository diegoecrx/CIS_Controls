# 5.1.2.3 Ensure journald is configured to compress large log files (Automated)

## Remediation

Edit the /etc/systemd/journald.conf file and add the following line:
Compress=yes
Restart the service:
# systemctl restart systemd-journald.service
Additional Information:
The main configuration file /etc/systemd/journald.conf is read before any of the
custom *.conf files. If there are custom configs present, they override the main
configuration parameters.
It is possible to change the default threshold of 512 bytes per object before compression
is used.
