# 5.2.3.16 Ensure successful and unsuccessful attempts to use the setfacl command are recorded

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Create audit rules

Edit or create a file in the /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory, ending inrules extension, with the relevant rules to monitor successful and unsuccessful attempts to use the setfacl command.

64 Bit systems

Example:

# {
 UID_MIN=$(awk '/^s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs)
 [ -n "${UID_MIN}" ] && printf "
-a always,exit -F path=/usr/bin/setfacl -F perm=x -F auid>=${UID_MIN} -F auid!=unset -k perm_chng
" >> /etc/audit/rules.d/50-perm_chng.rules || printf "ERROR: Variable 'UID_MIN' is unset.
"
}

Load audit rules

Merge and load the rules into active configuration:

# augenrules --load

Check if reboot is required.

# if [[ $(auditctl -s | grep "enabled") =~ "2" ]]; then printf "Reboot required to load rules
"; fi

32 Bit systems

Follow the same procedures as for 64 bit systems and ignore any entries with b64
