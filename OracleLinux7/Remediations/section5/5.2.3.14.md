# 5.2.3.14 Ensure events that modify the system's Mandatory Access Controls are collected (Automated)

## Remediation

Edit or create a file in the /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory, ending in .rules extension,
with the relevant rules to monitor events that modify the system's Mandatory Access
Controls.
Example:
# printf "
-w /etc/selinux -p wa -k MAC-policy
-w /usr/share/selinux -p wa -k MAC-policy
" >> /etc/audit/rules.d/50-MAC-policy.rules
Merge and load the rules into active configuration:
# augenrules --load
Check if reboot is required.
# if [[ $(auditctl -s | grep "enabled") =~ "2" ]]; then printf "Reboot
required to load rules\n"; fi




Additional Information:
Potential reboot required
If the auditing configuration is locked (-e 2), then augenrules will not warn in any way
that rules could not be loaded into the running configuration. A system reboot will be
required to load the rules into the running configuration.
System call structure
For performance (man 7 audit.rules) reasons it is preferable to have all the system
calls on one line. However, your configuration may have them on one line each or some
other combination. This is important to understand for both the auditing and remediation
sections as the examples given are optimized for performance as per the man page.
