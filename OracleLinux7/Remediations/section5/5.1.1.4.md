# 5.1.1.4 Ensure rsyslog default file permissions are configured

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```
\$FileCreateMode 0[0246][024]0[\s]*$
```

## Solution

Edit either /etc/rsyslog.conf or a dedicatedconf file in /etc/rsyslog.d/ and set $FileCreateMode to 0640 or more restrictive:

$FileCreateMode 0640

Restart the service:

# systemctl restart rsyslog

Impact:

The systems global umask could override, but only making the file permissions stricter, what is configured in RSyslog with the FileCreateMode directive. RSyslog also has its own $umask directive that can alter the intended file creation mode. In addition, consideration should be given to how FileCreateMode is used.

Thus it is critical to ensure that the intended file creation mode is not overridden with less restrictive settings in /etc/rsyslog.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/*conf files and that FileCreateMode is set before any file is created.
