# 5.2.2.4 Ensure system warns when audit logs are low on space

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Set the space_left_action parameter in /etc/audit/auditd.conf to email exec single or halt :

Example:

space_left_action = email

Set the admin_space_left_action parameter in /etc/audit/auditd.conf to single or halt :

Example:

admin_space_left_action = single

Note: A Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) must be installed and configured properly to set space_left_action = email

Impact:

If the admin_space_left_action is set to single the audit daemon will put the computer system in single user mode.
