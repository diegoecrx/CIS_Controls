# 5.1.2.4 Ensure journald is configured to write logfiles to persistent disk (Automated)

## Remediation

Edit the /etc/systemd/journald.conf file and add the following line:
Storage=persistent
Restart the service:
# systemctl restart systemd-journald.service
Additional Information:
The main configuration file /etc/systemd/journald.conf is read before any of the
custom *.conf files. If there are custom configs present, they override the main
configuration parameters.
