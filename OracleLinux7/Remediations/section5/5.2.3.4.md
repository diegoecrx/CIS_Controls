# 5.2.3.4 Ensure events that modify date and time information are collected

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Create audit rules

Edit or create a file in the /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory, ending inrules extension, with the relevant rules to monitor events that modify date and time information.

64 Bit systems

Example:

# printf "
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S adjtimex,settimeofday,clock_settime -k time-change
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S adjtimex,settimeofday,clock_settime -k time-change
-w /etc/localtime -p wa -k time-change
" >> /etc/audit/rules.d/50-time-change.rules

Load audit rules

Merge and load the rules into active configuration:

# augenrules --load

Check if reboot is required.

# if [[ $(auditctl -s | grep "enabled") =~ "2" ]]; then printf "Reboot required to load rules
"; fi

32 Bit systems

Follow the same procedures as for 64 bit systems and ignore any entries with b64 In addition, add stime to the system call audit. Example:

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S adjtimex,settimeofday,clock_settime,stime -k time-change
