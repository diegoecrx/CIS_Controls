# 5.2.3.10 Ensure successful file system mounts are collected (Automated)

## Remediation

Create audit rules

Edit or create a file in the /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory, ending in .rules extension,
with the relevant rules to monitor successful file system mounts.
64 Bit systems

Example:
# {
UID_MIN=$(awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs)
[ -n "${UID_MIN}" ] && printf "
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k mounts
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k mounts
" >> /etc/audit/rules.d/50-mounts.rules || printf "ERROR: Variable 'UID_MIN'
is unset.\n"
}
Load audit rules

Merge and load the rules into active configuration:
# augenrules --load
Check if reboot is required.
# if [[ $(auditctl -s | grep "enabled") =~ "2" ]]; then printf "Reboot
required to load rules\n"; fi
32 Bit systems

Follow the same procedures as for 64 bit systems and ignore any entries with b64.
