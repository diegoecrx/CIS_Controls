# 5.2.3.5 Ensure events that modify the system's network environment are collected

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Create audit rules

Edit or create a file in the /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory, ending inrules extension, with the relevant rules to monitor events that modify the system's network environment.

64 Bit systems

Example:

# printf "
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S sethostname,setdomainname -k system-locale
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S sethostname,setdomainname -k system-locale
-w /etc/issue -p wa -k system-locale
-w /etc/issue.net -p wa -k system-locale
-w /etc/hosts -p wa -k system-locale
-w /etc/sysconfig/network -p wa -k system-locale
-w /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ -p wa -k system-locale
" >> /etc/audit/rules.d/50-system_locale.rules

Load audit rules

Merge and load the rules into active configuration:

# augenrules --load

Check if reboot is required.

# if [[ $(auditctl -s | grep "enabled") =~ "2" ]]; then printf "Reboot required to load rules
"; fi

32 Bit systems

Follow the same procedures as for 64 bit systems and ignore any entries with b64
