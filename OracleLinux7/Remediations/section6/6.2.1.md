# 6.2.1 Ensure accounts in /etc/passwd use shadowed passwords

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash
/bin/awk -F: '($2 != "x" ) { print $1 " is not set to shadowed passwords "}' /etc/passwd | /bin/awk '{print} END {if (NR == 0) print "none"}'
```

**Expected Output:**
```
^none$
```

## Solution

Run the following command to set accounts to use shadowed passwords and migrate passwords in /etc/passwd to /etc/shadow :

# pwconv

Investigate to determine if the account is logged in and what it is being used for, to determine if it needs to be forced off.
