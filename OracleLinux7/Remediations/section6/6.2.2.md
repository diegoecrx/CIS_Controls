# 6.2.2 Ensure /etc/shadow password fields are not empty

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash
/bin/awk -F : '($2 == "") { print $1 " does not have a password."}' /etc/shadow | /bin/awk '{print} END {if (NR == 0) print "none"}'
```

**Expected Output:**
```
^none$
```

## Solution

If any accounts in the /etc/shadow file do not have a password, run the following command to lock the account until it can be determined why it does not have a password:

# passwd -l 

Also, check to see if the account is logged in and investigate what it is being used for to determine if it needs to be forced off.
