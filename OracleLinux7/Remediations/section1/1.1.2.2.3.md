# 1.1.2.2.3 Ensure nosuid option set on /dev/shm partition

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```
nosuid
```

## Solution

- IF - a separate partition exists for /dev/shm

Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nosuid to the fourth field (mounting options) for the /dev/shm partition. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.

Example:

tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0

Run the following command to remount /dev/shm with the configured options:

# mount -o remount /dev/shm

Note: It is recommended to use tmpfs as the device/filesystem type as /dev/shm is used as shared memory space by applications.
