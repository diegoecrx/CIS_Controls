# 1.5.1.6 Ensure no unconfined services exist

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash
/bin/ps -eZ | /bin/grep unconfined_service_t | /bin/awk -F: '{ print $NF } END {if (NR == 0) print "none"}'
```

**Expected Output:**
```
^none$
```

## Solution

Investigate any unconfined processes found during the audit action. They may need to have an existing security context assigned to them or a policy built for them.
