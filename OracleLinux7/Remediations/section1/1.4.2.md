# 1.4.2 Ensure ptrace_scope is restricted (Automated)

## Remediation

Set the following parameter in /etc/sysctl.conf or a file in /etc/sysctl.d/ ending in
.conf:
•
kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 1
Example:
# printf '%s\n' "kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 1" >> /etc/sysctl.d/60-
kernel_sysctl.conf
Run the following command to set the active kernel parameter:
# sysctl -w kernel.yama.ptrace_scope=1
Note: If these settings appear in a canonically later file, or later in the same file, these
settings will be overwritten
