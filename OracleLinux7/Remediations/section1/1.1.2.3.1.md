# 1.1.2.3.1 Ensure separate partition exists for /home (Automated)

## Remediation

For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a
separate partition for /home.
For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure
/etc/fstab as appropriate.
