# 1.2.3 Ensure repo_gpgcheck is globally activated

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Global configuration

Edit /etc/yum.conf and set repo_gpgcheck=1 in the [main] section.

Example:

[main]
repo_gpgcheck=1

Per repository configuration

First check that the particular repository support GPG checking on the repodata.

Edit any failing files in /etc/yum.repos.d/* and set all instances starting with repo_gpgcheck to 1

Impact:

Not all repositories, notably RedHat, support repo_gpgcheck Take care to set this value to false (default) for particular repositories that do not support it. If enabled on repositories that do not support repo_gpgcheck installation of packages will fail.

Research is required by the user to determine which repositories is configured on the local system and, from that list, which support repo_gpgcheck
