# 1.1.2.1.4 Ensure noexec option set on /tmp partition

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```
noexec
```

## Solution

- IF - a separate partition exists for /tmp

Edit the /etc/fstab file and add noexec to the fourth field (mounting options) for the /tmp partition.

Example:

 /tmp  defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0

Run the following command to remount /tmp with the configured options:

# mount -o remount /tmp

Impact:

Setting the noexec option on /tmp may prevent installation and/or updating of some 3rd party software.
