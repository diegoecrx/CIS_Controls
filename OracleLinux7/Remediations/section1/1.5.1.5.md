# 1.5.1.5 Ensure the SELinux mode is enforcing

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Run the following command to set SELinux's running mode:

# setenforce 1

Edit the /etc/selinux/config file to set the SELINUX parameter:

For Enforcing mode:

SELINUX=enforcing

Impact:

Running SELinux in Enforcing mode may block intended access to files or processes if the SELinux policy is not correctly configured. If this occurs, review the system logs for details and update labels or policy as appropriate.
