# 1.3.1 Ensure bootloader password is set

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash
multiple line script
```

**Expected Output:**
```
GRUB2_PASSWORD=grub.pbkdf2.sha512
```

**Timeout:** 7200 seconds

## Solution

Create an encrypted password with grub2-setpassword :

# grub2-setpassword

Enter password: 
Confirm password: 

Note: Requires version 7.2 or later

Impact:

If password protection is enabled, only the designated superuser can edit a GRUB 2 menu item by pressing e or access the GRUB 2 command line by pressing c

If GRUB 2 is set up to boot automatically to a password-protected menu entry the user has no option to back out of the password prompt to select another menu entry. Holding the SHIFT key will not display the menu in this case. The user must enter the correct username and password. If unable, the configuration files will have to be edited via the LiveCD or other means to fix the problem
