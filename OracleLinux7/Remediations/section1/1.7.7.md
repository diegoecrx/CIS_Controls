# 1.7.7 Ensure GDM disabling automatic mounting of removable media is not overridden

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash
multiple line script
```

**Expected Output:**
```
(?i)^[\s]*\**[\s]*pass:?[\s]*\**$
```

## Solution

Run the following script to lock disable automatic mounting of media for all GNOME users:

#!/usr/bin/env bash

{
   # Check if GNMOE Desktop Manager is installed. If package isn't installed, recommendation is Not Applicable

   # determine system's package manager
   l_pkgoutput=""
   if command -v dpkg-query > /dev/null 2>&1; then
      l_pq="dpkg-query -W"
   elif command -v rpm > /dev/null 2>&1; then
      l_pq="rpm -q"
   fi
   # Check if GDM is installed
   l_pcl="gdm gdm3" # Space seporated list of packages to check
   for l_pn in $l_pcl; do
      $l_pq "$l_pn" > /dev/null 2>&1 && l_pkgoutput="y" && echo -e "
 - Package: \"$l_pn\" exists on the system
 - remediating configuration if needed"
   done
   # Check configuration (If applicable)
   if [ -n "$l_pkgoutput" ]; then
      # Look for automount to determine profile in use, needed for remaining tests
      l_kfd="/etc/dconf/db/$(grep -Psril '^h*automountb' /etc/dconf/db/*/ | awk -F'/' '{split($(NF-1),a,".");print a[1]}').d" #set directory of key file to be locked

         if grep -Priq '^h*/org/gnome/desktop/media-handling/automountb' "$l_kfd"; then
            echo " - \"automount\" is locked in \"$(grep -Pril '^h*/org/gnome/desktop/media-handling/automountb' "$l_kfd")\""
         else

            [ ! -d "$l_kfd"/locks ] && echo "creating directory $l_kfd/locks" && mkdir "$l_kfd"/locks

               echo '/org/gnome/desktop/media-handling/automount'
            } >> "$l_kfd"/locks/00-media-automount
         fi
      else
         echo -e " - \"automount\" is not set so it can not be locked
 - Please follow Recommendation \"Ensure GDM automatic mounting of removable media is disabled\" and follow this Recommendation again"
      fi
      if [ -d "$l_kfd2" ]; then # If key file directory doesn't exist, options can't be locked
         if grep -Priq '^h*/org/gnome/desktop/media-handling/automount-openb' "$l_kfd2"; then
            echo " - \"automount-open\" is locked in \"$(grep -Pril '^h*/org/gnome/desktop/media-handling/automount-openb' "$l_kfd2")\""

         fi
      else
         echo -e " - \"automount-open\" is not set so it can not be locked
 - Please follow Recommendation \"Ensure GDM automatic mounting of removable media is disabled\" and follow this Recommendation again"
      fi
      # update dconf database
      dconf update
   else
      echo -e " - GNOME Desktop Manager package is not installed on the system
 - Recommendation is not applicable"

Impact:

The use of portable hard drives is very common for workstation users
