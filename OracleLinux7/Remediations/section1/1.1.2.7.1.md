# 1.1.2.7.1 Ensure separate partition exists for /var/log/audit

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```
[\s]+/var/log/audit[\s]+
```

## Solution

For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /var/log/audit

For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate.

Impact:

Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may introduce their own security considerations.
