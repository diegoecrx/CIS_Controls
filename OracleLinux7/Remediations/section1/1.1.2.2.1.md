# 1.1.2.2.1 Ensure /dev/shm is a separate partition

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```
[\s]+/dev/shm[\s]+
```

## Solution

For specific configuration requirements of the /dev/shm mount for your environment, modify /etc/fstab

Example:

tmpfs	/dev/shm	tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G 0 0

Impact:

Since the /dev/shm directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition.

/dev/shm utilizing tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter in the relevant entry in /etc/fstab
