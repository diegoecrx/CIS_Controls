# 1.1.2.2.2 Ensure nodev option set on /dev/shm partition (Automated)

## Remediation

- IF - a separate partition exists for /dev/shm.
Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nodev to the fourth field (mounting options) for the
/dev/shm partition. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.
Example:
tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0
Run the following command to remount /dev/shm with the configured options:
# mount -o remount /dev/shm
Note: It is recommended to use tmpfs as the device/filesystem type as /dev/shm is used
as shared memory space by applications.
