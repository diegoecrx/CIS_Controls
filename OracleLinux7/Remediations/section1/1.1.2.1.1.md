# 1.1.2.1.1 Ensure /tmp is a separate partition

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash
/bin/findmnt -nk /tmp
```

**Expected Output:**
```
^[\s]*/tmp[\s]+
```

## Solution

Create or update an entry for /tmp in /etc/fstab :

_ Example:_

tmpfs	/tmp	tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0

Run the following command to remount /tmp

# mount -o remount,noexec,nodev,nosuid /tmp

- OR - if /tmp is not already mounted, run the following command to mount /tmp :

# mount /tmp

Impact:

By design files saved to /tmp should have no expectation of surviving a reboot of the system. tmpfs is ram based and all files stored to tmpfs will be lost when the system is rebooted.

If files need to be persistent through a reboot, they should be saved to /var/tmp not /tmp

Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to tmpfs or a separate partition.

Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a configuration where /tmp is not a separate file system it will essentially have the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp (as with tmpfs ) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for /tmp from a separate volume or disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower than tmpfs which is RAM-based.
