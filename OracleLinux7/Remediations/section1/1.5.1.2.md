# 1.5.1.2 Ensure SELinux is not disabled in bootloader configuration

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Run the following command to remove the selinux=0 and enforcing=0 parameters:

grubby --update-kernel ALL --remove-args "selinux=0 enforcing=0"

Edit /etc/default/grub and remove selinux=0 and enforcing=0 from all lines beginning with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX= or GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT= :

Example:

# sed -ri 's/s*(selinux|enforcing)=0s*//g' /etc/default/grub

Impact:

Files created while SELinux is disabled are not labeled at all. This behavior causes problems when changing to enforcing mode because files are labeled incorrectly or are not labeled at all. To prevent incorrectly labeled and unlabeled files from causing problems, file systems are automatically relabeled when changing from the disabled state to permissive or enforcing mode. This can be a long running process that should be accounted for as it may extend downtime during initial re-boot.
