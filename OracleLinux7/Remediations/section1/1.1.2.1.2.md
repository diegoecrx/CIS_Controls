## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**

## Solution

- IF - a separate partition exists for /tmp

Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nodev to the fourth field (mounting options) for the /tmp partition.

Run the following command to remount /tmp with the configured options:

# mount -o remount /tmp
