# 3.4.3.4 Ensure nftables base chains exist

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Run the following command to create the base chains:

# nft create chain inet   { type filter hook  priority 0 ; }

Example:

# nft create chain inet filter input { type filter hook input priority 0 ; }
# nft create chain inet filter forward { type filter hook forward priority 0 ; }
# nft create chain inet filter output { type filter hook output priority 0 ; }

Impact:

If configuring nftables over ssh, creating a base chain with a policy of drop will cause loss of connectivity.

Ensure that a rule allowing ssh has been added to the base chain prior to setting the base chain's policy to drop
