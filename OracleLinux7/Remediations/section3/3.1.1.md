# 3.1.1 Ensure IPv6 status is identified

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash
/bin/grep -Pqs '^\h*0\b' /sys/module/ipv6/parameters/disable && echo -e "\n - IPv6 is enabled\n" || echo -e "\n - IPv6 is not enabled\n"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Manual Review Required
```

## Solution

Enable or disable IPv6 in accordance with system requirements and local site policy

Impact:

IETF RFC 4038 recommends that applications are built with an assumption of dual stack.

When enabled, IPv6 will require additional configuration to reduce risk to the system.
