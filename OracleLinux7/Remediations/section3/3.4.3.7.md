# 3.4.3.7 Ensure nftables default deny firewall policy

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Run the following command for the base chains with the input, forward, and output hooks to implement a default DROP policy:

# nft chain    { policy drop ; }

Example:

# nft chain inet filter input { policy drop ; }
# nft chain inet filter forward { policy drop ; }
# nft chain inet filter output { policy drop ; }

Impact:

If configuring nftables over ssh, creating a base chain with a policy of drop will cause loss of connectivity.

Ensure that a rule allowing ssh has been added to the base chain prior to setting the base chain's policy to drop
