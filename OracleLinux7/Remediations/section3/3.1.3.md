## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash

```

**Expected Output:**
```

```

## Solution

Run the following commands to stop bluetooth.service and remove the bluez package:

# systemctl stop bluetooth.service
# yum remove bluez

-OR-

-IF- the bluez package is required as a dependency:

Run the following commands to stop and mask bluetooth.service :

# systemctl stop bluetooth.service
# systemctl mask bluetooth.service

Note: A reboot may be required

Impact:

Many personal electronic devices (PEDs) use Bluetooth technology. For example, you may be able to operate your computer with a wireless keyboard. Disabling Bluetooth will prevent these devices from connecting to the system.

There may be packages that are dependent on the bluez package. If the bluez package is removed, these dependent packages will be removed as well. Before removing the bluez package, review any dependent packages to determine if they are required on the system.

-IF- a dependent package is required: stop and mask bluetooth.service leaving the bluez package installed.
