# 3.3.2 Ensure packet redirect sending is disabled

## Compliance Requirement

**Command to Check:**
```bash
multiple line script
```

**Expected Output:**
```
(?i)^[\s]*\**[\s]*pass:?[\s]*\**$
```

**Timeout:** 7200 seconds

## Solution

Set the following parameters in /etc/sysctl.conf or a file in /etc/sysctl.d/ ending inconf :

 - net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0
 - net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects = 0

Example:

# printf '%s
' "net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0" "net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects = 0" >> /etc/sysctl.d/60-netipv4_sysctl.conf

Run the following command to set the active kernel parameters:

# {
   sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects=0
   sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects=0
   sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1
}

Note: If these settings appear in a canonically later file, or later in the same file, these settings will be overwritten

Impact:

IP forwarding is required on systems configured to act as a router. If these parameters are disabled, the system will not be able to perform as a router.
