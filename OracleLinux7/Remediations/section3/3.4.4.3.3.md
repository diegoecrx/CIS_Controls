# 3.4.4.3.3 Ensure ip6tables firewall rules exist for all open ports (Automated)

## Remediation

For each port identified in the audit which does not have a firewall rule establish a
proper rule for accepting inbound connections:
# ip6tables -A INPUT -p <protocol> --dport <port> -m state --state NEW -j
ACCEPT
